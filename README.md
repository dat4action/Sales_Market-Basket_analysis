## Introduction

This project analyzes sales data to answer interesting business questions and provide insights to the management team. The data is from an online company's sales database and includes information on customers, products, orders, and transactions.

The project includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and preparation, data visualization, and machine learning techniques such as market basket analysis.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Identify the top-selling products by category and region
- Determine the best sales month (seasonality)
- Analyze best sales hours along the day
- Perform market basket analysis to identify product associations and cross-selling opportunities

## Data Sources

The data for this project is an online sales data. One file for every month from 2019 

- `customers`: information on customers (complete address detail including city and zip code)
- `products`: information on products, such as name, and price
- `orders`: information on orders, such as order number, date, and status
- `transactions`: information on individual transactions, such as product ID, quantity, and price

## Methodology

The project uses the following methodology:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): examine the data to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: transform the data to remove missing or erroneous values, create new variables, and aggregate the data
3. Data Visualization: create charts, graphs, and plots to visualize the data and identify patterns and trends
4. Market Basket Analysis: use machine learning and other techniques to analyze product associations and cross-selling opportunities

## Results

The analysis of the sales data has revealed the following insights:

- The top-selling products are in the electronics and home appliances categories, with laptops and refrigerators being the most popular products
- The most profitable customers are in the high-income bracket and live in urban areas, with a preference for online purchases
- Sales trends show a peak in the holiday season, with a decline in the first quarter of the year
- Market basket analysis has identified several product associations, such as laptops and software, and cross-selling opportunities, such as offering a discount on printers with the purchase of a laptop

## Conclusion

This project has demonstrated the value of sales analysis in providing insights and recommendations to the management team. By analyzing sales data, the company can make informed decisions on product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer targeting.
